# # before starting the assignment, learnig from class :

# print(15/2) # gives proper divison - 7.5
# print(15//2) # gives quotient - 7
# print(15%2) # gives remainder - 1
# print(15*2.0) # int with float = float
# print(15**2) # to the power of - 15^2 = 225
# print(round(2.35,1)) # round
# print(abs(-4.0)) # absolute value

# a = 9.7 
# print(a.is_integer()) # this method is to check for value is integer or not and in this case it is false

# list

# ipl = ['CSK','MI','RCB','LSG']
# print(type(ipl))
# print(ipl[1])

# ipl[1] = 'KKR' # list are mutable

# print(ipl)

# ipl[4] = 'MI' # this will not add in last
# ipl.append("MI") # this will add in last also string should be in double quotes
# print(ipl)

# ipl.insert(1,"KXIP") # it will add the value at the index you gave and push all values to back
# ipl.extend([1,2]) # pass a list and it will add the elements to to list you wanted
# ipl.pop() # remove last element

# print(ipl)
# print(ipl[0][0:2].lower())
